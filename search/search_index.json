However, designing efficient and scalable applications in Python presents unique challenges, driving the development of innovative frameworks. For example, tools like JAX offer a tensor-based programming model inspired by NumPy, which can be mapped to multi-GPU execution. While these abstractions provide significant capabilities, they often obscure low-level details, limiting the user's ability to write optimal code. Tensor-based frameworks often struggle with efficient conditional logic, loops, and memory management.</p> <p>NVIDIA Warp introduces a new solution: a Python multi-GPU programming model with a CUDA-like interface. This approach empowers developers to write high-performance, fine-grained parallel code in Python with CUDA-level efficiency. Warp leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation not only to directly generate and compile CUDA code but also to provide a differentiable programming interface, which is essential for optimization and AI workflows.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we will introduce the Warp multi-GPU programming model and demonstrate how to write high-performance, multi-GPU applications in Python. Beginning with simple Warp kernel development and profiling, we will progress to more advanced features such as automatic differentiability and multi-GPU programming.</p>"},{"location":"#schedule","title":"Schedule","text":""},{"location":"#day-one","title":"Day One","text":"Time Description Status Documentation Provides detailed instructions \u2705 Done Tutorials Step-by-step usage guides \ud83d\udea7 WIP Support Community and professional support \u274c Not yet"},{"location":"#day-two","title":"Day Two","text":"Time Description Status Documentation Provides detailed instructions \u2705 Done Tutorials Step-by-step usage guides \ud83d\udea7 WIP Support Community and professional support \u274c Not yet"},{"location":"#reading-list","title":"Reading list","text":""},{"location":"#tutorial-setup","title":"Tutorial setup","text":""}]}
